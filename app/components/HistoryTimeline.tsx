            In the 2019-20 fire season (November 2019 until February 2020),
            Victoria endured extreme fire conditions with over 1.5 million
            hectares burnt, immeasurable impact on unique environments, 420
            houses lost, and five fatalities. Communities in East Gippsland were
            isolated for weeks as thousands of kilometres of roads and critical
            infrastructure were rendered unserviceable. In addition, the
            bushfires have had a significant impact on wildlife and
            biodiversity.

            The Lancefield-Cobaw Croziers Track planned burn was ignited on
            Wednesday 30 September 2015 in the Macedon Ranges Shire in spring
            2015. The fires breached containment lines on Saturday 3 October and
            was brought under control overnight with approximately 70 additional
            hectares burnt. Further breaches of containment lines occurred on
            Tuesday 6 October and control of the bushfire was transferred from
            the Midlands District to the Gisborne Incident Control Centre (ICC)
            that afternoon. The bushfire, when finally contained on Tuesday 13
            October, had burnt over 3,000ha and destroyed several dwellings,
            numerous sheds and many kilometres of fencing. It had also impacted
            upon lifestyles, livestock and livelihoods and caused considerable
            economic and social upheaval in the surrounding communities.
